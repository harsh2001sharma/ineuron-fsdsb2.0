1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans.
There are two Boolean values:
True: Represents truth or "on."
False: Represents falsity or "off."

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans.
There are three Boolean operators:
and: Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise returns False.
or: Returns True if at least one operand is True, otherwise returns False.
not (unary operator): Flips the value of a single operand (e.g., not True is False).

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans.
AND Operator:
True AND True = True
True AND False = False
False AND True = False
False AND False = False

OR Operator:
True OR True = True
True OR False = True
False OR True = True
False OR False = False

NOT Operator:
NOT True = False
NOT False = True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
Ans.
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5): False (5 is greater than 4 is True, but 3 is not equal to 5)
not (5 > 4): False (5 is greater than 4 is True, negating it makes it False)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5): True (at least one condition is True)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)): False (the inner expression is True, negating it makes it False)
(True and True) and (True == False): False (the second condition is False)
(not False) or (not True): True (both negations are True, so at least one is True)

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans.
==: Equal to
!=: Not equal to
>: Greater than
<: Less than
>=: Greater than or equal to
<=: Less than or equal to

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans.
== checks for equality and returns a Boolean value (True or False).
= assigns a value to a variable.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Ans.
spam = 0  
if spam == 10:  # Block 1: Indented under the if statement
    print('eggs')  # Inside Block 1
if spam > 5:  # Block 2: Indented under the if statement
    print('bacon')  # Inside Block 2
else:  # Inside Block 3, else statement
    print('ham')  # Inside Block 3
print('spam')  
print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans.

spam = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Get input from user and convert to integer
if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans.
Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + C simultaneously.
Mac: Press Command + Option + Esc simultaneously.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans.
break: Exits the entire loop immediately.
continue: Skips to the next iteration of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans.
range(10): Generates numbers from 0 to 9 (exclusive of 10).
range(0, 10): Same as range(10).
range(0, 10, 1): Explicitly specifies a step of 1 (default anyway).

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans.
# Using a for loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
# Using a while loop
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans.
After importing the spam module, we will call the bacon() function using dot notation. 
import spam
spam.bacon()
