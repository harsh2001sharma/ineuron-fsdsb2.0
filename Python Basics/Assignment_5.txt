1. What does an empty dictionary's code look like?
Ans.
An empty dictionary is created using curly braces {}:
empty_dict = {}

2. What is the value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42?
Ans.
To access the value associated with a key in a dictionary, use square brackets [] after the dictionary variable and the key:
my_dict = {'foo': 42}
value = my_dict['foo']  # value will be 42


3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?
Ans.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable (like strings or numbers). Accessing elements is done using keys.
Lists: Ordered collections of items. Accessing elements is done using zero-based indexing.

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?
Ans.
If we try to access a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary spam, we'll get a KeyError:
spam = {'bar': 100}
try:
    value = spam['foo']  # This will raise a KeyError
except KeyError:
    print("Key 'foo' not found in the dictionary.")

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?
Ans.
'cat' in spam: Checks if a key named "cat" exists in the dictionary spam. Returns True if it exists, False otherwise.
'cat' in spam.keys(): Checks if a key named "cat" exists among the keys of the dictionary spam. This is a more explicit way of checking for key existence.

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
Ans.
'cat' in spam: Checks for a key named "cat" (as mentioned above).
'cat' in spam.values(): Checks if a value named "cat" exists among the values of the dictionary spam. This is useful if you're searching for a specific value regardless of its corresponding key.

7. What is a shortcut for the following code?
if 'color' not in spam:
spam['color'] = 'black'
Ans.
The get() method provides a way to add a default value if the key doesn't exist:
spam.get('color', 'black')  # Returns 'black' if 'color' is not in spam, otherwise returns the value associated with 'color'

8. How do you "pretty print" dictionary values using which module and function?
Use the pprint module (available in Python's standard library) and its pprint() function:
import pprint

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
pprint.pprint(my_dict)
